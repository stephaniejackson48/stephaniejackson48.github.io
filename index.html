         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>
         I am currently a 4th-year undergraduate at the University of Liverpool, studying Business Management (BA). 
         Originally from Bristol, moving to Liverpool for university and later to London for my placement year as I 
         have a keen interest of exploring new cities and meeting new people. During my third year, I undertook a 13-month 
         placement at Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a Communications and Programmes Intern. This experience allowed me to build
         confidence and develop skills across corporate communications, event coordination, and content creation for both internal 
         and external audiences.

         Moving to London not only gave me valuable professional experience but also enabled me to grow personally. I challenged
         myself to get involved in new activities, such as joining a social run club and a book club, to connect with different
         communities. My placement also supported my passion for travelling and learning about new cultures. This ambition first 
         began during my gap year, when I independently planned and funded a three-month trip abroad while taking time away from 
         my hospitality job. The experience strengthened my confidence, cultural adaptability, and problem-solving skills, while 
         fuelling a lasting enthusiasm for exploring new places and cultures.

         I am an ambitious individual seeking a career that will continuously challenge me, broaden my skills, and encourage 
         innovative thinking. I am motivated by opportunities that push me to question conventional approaches, learn new things, 
         and find creative ways of achieving results.
