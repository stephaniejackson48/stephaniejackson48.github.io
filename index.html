         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>
            I am currently a third year student at the University of Liverpool studying Business Management (BA). During my third year I decided to undertake a 13-month placement at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. My role is Communications and Programmes located in London. At University I am a very sociable person joining many societies including, yoga, and korfball, two activities
I have always been ambitious to try. I am keen on working in teams and building strong relationships
with team members, I portrayed this in my involvement in Young Enterprise where my role was the
facilitator ensuring all tasks ran smoothly. I used my analytical and digital skills to create schedules
and timetables for deadlines, so team members knew when activities were happening. I believe this
experience allowed me to gain self-confidence as I became vigilant in identifying potential concerns
with individuals and speaking up in certain situations when needed. Furthermore, integrity is a key
value of mine that I portray in everyday life, for example, in my work experience I was honest and
kept to my principles which allowed me to gain skills in customer experience making me ambitious
to learn more. I am also very committed and understand responsibility is key which enabled me to
gain the academic award of ‘Mrs Grafter’ showing my hard work and efforts in my final year of
college. I pride myself in being a resilient and ambitious person with a passion for continuous
learning and personal development.
